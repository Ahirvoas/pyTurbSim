Testing TurbGen
====

To test TurbGen, make sure you have `pytest` installed, and then run:

    >> pytest

The data and images in the `data/` folder are regenerated by running the `make_data.py` script.

The `inp_files/` folder contains the input files used to generate the data in `/data/ts`, and the folder `misc` contains the old TurbSim executable used to generate the data in `data/ts/`, along with an assortment of other legacy scripts.
