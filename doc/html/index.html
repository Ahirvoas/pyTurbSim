<div class="textblock"><p>PyTurbSim is a program for producing simulations of turbulent velocity time-series for input to device simulation tools (e.g. the NWTC's FAST) that estimate wind- and water-turbine performance and loads. PyTurbSim outputs 2-D planes (i.e. y-z) of 3-component velocity (u,v,w) time-series [1]. In other words, PyTurbSim provides the inflow information that 'drives' device simulations.</p>
<p>PyTurbSim is the official water-turbulence simulation tool for marine hydrokinetic (MHK) turbine device simulation (a.k.a. HydroTurbSim), and is also designed to be a valuable development and testing platform for NREL's 'TurbSim' tool [2].</p>
<p>History ------- pyTurbSim is a python-implementation of the National Wind Technology Center's (NWTC) 'TurbSim' program. Throughout the documentation, the term 'TurbSim' is used to refer to both PyTurbSim and the original TurbSim tool (hereafter 'o-TurbSim'). O-TurbSim can be downloaded here: <a href="https://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/preprocessors/turbsim/">https://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/preprocessors/turbsim/</a></p>
<p>PyTurbSim was originally written as a script for developing and testing new profile and turbulence models that would later be incorporated into o-TurbSim. The idea was that the script could be quickly modified and executed to produce new output that could be compared to measured datasets (for validating new models) or o-TurbSim output (for validating the script). Once a new model had been developed it could then be incorporated into o-TurbSim and released as part of o-TurbSim. As the 'PyTurbSim script' was developed to simplify its use it became a full-fledged program of its own with some capabilities that exceed o-TurbSim. O-TurbSim has capabilities that are not included in PyTurbSim as well; see the capabilities.txt file for a comparison of capabilities of these two tools.</p>
<p>The PyTurbSim documentation is largely based on O-TurbSim's documentation. For additional information consider looking at that document: <a href="https://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/preprocessors/turbsim/TurbSim.pdf">https://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/preprocessors/turbsim/TurbSim.pdf</a></p>
<p>Background ----------</p>
<p>TurbSim is a 'statistical', rather than 'dynamic' tool. That is, rather than solving fluid-flow equations (e.g. large eddy simulations) it produces time-series that match specific statistics of real flows. PyTurbSim is capable of matching the following statistics of any velocity dataset: 1) the mean velocity profile, 2) the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum (and therefore the turbulence intensity), 3) the Reynold's stress profile, and 4) the spatial coherence. These statistics have been found to be critical predictors of wind-turbine fatigue loading. Therefore, though this tool does not produce time-series that obey fluid-flow equations (i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations, compressibility), it does provide time-series that drive realistic wind and MHK turbine device simulation and it does so using significantly lower computational resources than fluid-flow simulations. That is, TurbSim and PyTurbSim efficiently produce time-series that drive realistic loads estimates that agree reasonably with measurements of loads on real wind turbines [3].</p>
<p>A primary difference between o-TurbSim and PyTurbSim is that PyTurbSim is designed to facilitate explicit user-control of the four statistics listed above. O-TurbSim, on the other hand, is designed so that a user selects from a pre-defined subset of these statistics.</p>
<p>Usage -----</p>
<p>PyTurbSim has three primary operational modes/interfaces. 1) input files, 2) direct python interface, and 3) a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>-- Input Files (runConfig package) This mode is designed to mimic the o-TurbSim interface. It is designed for use by device developers and other users familiar with the o-TurbSim program who want output that is consistent with predifined models built into TurbSim. In this mode pyTurbSim reads o-TurbSim input files and writes out binary data in the same format as o-TurbSim. This mode can be run from a standard (i.e. DOS, UNIX) command line and is well suited for interfacing with FAST and other device simulation tools in the same way that o-TurbSim does. For more information on this mode, see the docstring in the runConfig/__init__.py file.</p>
<p>-- Python Interface (api.py file) This is the core interface of PyTurbSim (the other two are wrappers). As such, this mode provides more control over output (access to lower-level functions). This interface was designed for controlling the four statistics above (in the Background section) explicitly without modifying the program itself. It is likely to be particularly useful to users familiar with python who are developing and testing new turbulence models that will be incorporated into the tool. As a starting point for using this interface see the api.py docstring.</p>
<p>-- Graphical User Interface (gui package, aka gTurbSim) A graphical user interface (gui) was developed for reading and writing TurbSim input files. The gui was designed to help new users of TurbSim in understanding and writing input files. The gui can be used to run O-TurbSim. The python script gTurbSim.py will run the gui. For more information see the gui/__init__.py docstring.</p>
<p>Dependencies ------------</p>
<p>PyTurbSim depends only on Python and numpy. The gui (gTurbSim) also requires wxPython.</p>
<p>Notes and Citations -------------------</p>
<p>[1] At the most basic level PyTurbSim output is a four-dimensional array. The dimensions are: 1) velocity component (size 3, corresponding to u,v,w), 2) z spatial dimension (size n_z = number of z-points) 3) y spatial dimension (size n_y = number of y-points) 4) time dimension (size n_t = number of timesteps) TurbSim implicitly makes the 'frozen flow hypothesis' and so the time-dimension can also, roughly, be considered the x spatial dimension.</p>
<p>[2] The NWTC is a center at the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). The DOE provided funding for development of these tools.</p>
